								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Imagine you get home from work, school, or any day's worth of activities and you're trying to relax your mind with some entertainment. You want to watch new content from anything you've been following continuously whether it's a tv series, youtube channel, movies you planned to watch, or even a livestream. Unfortunately the time it takes to find what you want is stacked up by constantly switching through different apps and trying to find what's new and available.<br/><br/>Our goal was to create an app that allows users to find all entertainment services by just using one platform. Users would no longer have to switch from app to app to find shows, movies, and live streams that they want to watch.</p>

						<p style = "font-size: 20px">Our team was formed by random with a total of 4 members, and after a week of getting to know everyone and getting comfortable the team nominated me as the leader for my ideas.<br/><br/>
							My role in my team was <b>Project Manager/User Researcher/Prototyping.</b> I became in charge of all the meetings, finalizing ideas, and making sure we hit all the criteria and deadlines. I organized meeting times that worked for everyone, and each meeting were progressive steps on the project including research, user personas, storyboarding, etc.. I made sure I asked for everyone's input so no one felt like they weren't being heard while also having them provide different perspectives to help us narrow down exactly what we were looking for. </p>

							<h2>Ideation</h2>
						</header>
						<p style = "font-size: 18px">When the groups were formed the professor gave us different categories of apps that we can choose from that involved solving a user problem. Our first meeting we all collectively decided to go with the category of "Creative Social Life," and from there I gave the team a task of coming up with at least 3 different app ideas. After a few days we came together again and gave all of our ideas. I facilitated the meeting, and gave everyone a turn to present their 3 different ideas. After everyone presented we all gave our votes coming to a consensus of my idea being , "being able to find entertainment with ease."<br/><br/>
						Everyone seemed to like the idea because of how relatable it was to each member, and they felt as if it was a fun problem to tackle. We then went over all the details and tried to narrow down on what the main problem was. Each member was tasked with researching about different streaming services, and people's complaints related to our app. Then after researching each member came up with a problem statement with multiple solutions. These problems were how we finalized and solidified on how our app was going to be designed, and came up with the name <b>"Sort,"</b> deriving from the ability to sort one's entertainment through an app.</p>
