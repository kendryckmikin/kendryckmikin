										<h2>The Struggle of Content Exploration</h2>
										<p>How can we make finding content to watch efficient and easy?</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>The days of scrolling through TV channels and trying to find a show or movie to watch on the couch is now over, but instead it is replaced by going through different entertainment applications and streaming services. The main problem with this new form of entertainment is shuffling through different applications to try and find what you want to watch, whether it’s keeping track of where you left off or trying to find a new show. <br/><br/>Me and my team created an app that gives users that struggle to find content to watch an organizational hub that unites multiple streaming services for effortless viewing. These users no longer have to waste countless minutes from shuffling between apps just to find the perfect content to watch.</p>

							<h2>Approaching the Problem</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>What did I do?</b><br/><br/>My role in my team was Project Manager/User Researcher/Prototyping. I became in charge of all the meetings, finalizing ideas, and making sure we hit all the criteria and deadlines. I organized meeting times that worked for everyone, and each meeting were progressive steps on the project including research, user personas, storyboarding, etc.. I made sure I asked for everyone's input so no one felt like they weren't being heard while also having them provide different perspectives to help us narrow down exactly what we were looking for.<br/><br/>
							<b>Research Methods</b><br/><br/>While thinking of how the app is going to be designed is important, approaching the problem and understanding user needs and struggles comes first. I gave myself and my team four different focuses to research on: Types of streaming services, feedback from streaming users who use paid subscriptions, who the target aduience is, and what problems people faced using streaming services. The type of research done was doing competitive analyses, sorting through relevant articles, and finding user feedback through media platforms such as reddit. With all the research done I was able to get a better idea of who our target audience is and came up with a couple of user personas that fit the description.</p>

							<h2>Obstacles Faced and Design Process</h2>
						</header>
						<p><b>What issues were found?</b><br/><br/>From our user personas and extensive research we found our demographic to be very diverse and didn’t know how to dive into a specific route. We did competitive research and analysis with other streaming services, but this hindered our ability to gain inspiration for how the application can be laid out since it was a new idea at the time with no other similar apps to reference to.<br/><br/>
						<b>How did I face these issues?</b><br/><br/>With the demographic/scope being so trivial the best way to go about this was to generate problem statements, and come up with solutions. Me and my team came up with 4 problem statements, and came up with as many solutions we could think of for each. With the solutions we came up with I chose the 6 best. With that we then turned them into 6 different storyboards that gave a better idea of how the app became useful to users who watch content.</p>

							<h2>Bringing it All Together</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Lo-Fi and Interviews</b><br/><li>As a team we collectively came up with different sketches in order to feed ideas into each others brains and how the user flow could be mapped out</li><li>After creating a lo-fi prototype we conducted interviews with participants of all different demographics that at the same time fit our persona descriptions </li><li>Through our interviews and extensive research we were able to take the insight and put it into the hi-fi prototype and everything started to fall into place smoothly </li><li>I made the team create a moodboard to get a theme going for the app design and then from there came up with a final style guide</li><br/><br/>
						<b>How it All Came Together</b><br/> 
						Going through all of our competitive analysis, extensive research through articles, and finding what our ideal users want and how they can benefit from our app. 
						The research and ideation process is really the backbone of the project, the hi-fi prototype and how it came out was all just busy work but none of it could be done without the preparation.</p>

							<h2>Consideration and Growth Opportunities</h2>
							<p>Sort has potential to be useful for not just users that need content to watch, but even the average consumer. There are still many considerations to take into account such as giving more ogranization options, making the app more familiar to pre-existing streaming services, and fixing up the font/style-guide to be a bit more clean and modern. Future steps that can be taken is to implement more user research and get feedback to further improve the app. </p>
