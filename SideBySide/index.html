						<h2>Why does Tik-Tok need a redesign?</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left;">Have you ever seen a Tik-Tok trend that you thought looked fun and easy to make in a few minutes? Then when you actually try to get into the process of filming and editing the Tik-Tok you end up staying there for way longer than you expected, just trying to get the perfect take and attempting to precisely line up transition cuts. Then with the filming process done, you’re there for even longer trying to edit the Tik-Tok and end up unsatisfied with a few clips so you’d have to restart the filming process again. This becomes a burden as a content creator because of the amount of time already spent on the Tik-Tok goes down the drain. Tik-Tok is a growing app that has over 1.6 billion users on it as of 2023, so giving the ability to create quality content on Tik-Tok is very important for their content creators that have to entertain the vast amount of users.<br /><br/>
						The issue is that Tik-Tok content creators need a more efficient way to cut, refilm, and edit their content in order to make the entire filming and editing process easy and intuitive.</p>

										<h3>My Role</h3>

									<p>I was chosen as the team leader for this project and with the role as team leader I set up all the meetings, communicated back and forth with the professor and his input, made sure everyone’s insight was taken into account and made final decisions. </p>

										<h3>Constraints</h3>
									</header>
									<p>The prompt that was addressed to us was to come up with an innovative idea that makes production efficient. This can be for any application as long as it's related to production.</p>

										<h3>Motivation</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Our initial motivation was diving into short videos’ design/creative process as it’s popularity is going to only increase from now. So our biggest challenge was trying to figure out how we could make the entire creative process easier and more efficient for users that make content catered for short videos</p>

						<h2>Narrowing Down the Scope of the Project</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left;">We went over 24 total ideas with their own sketches relating to mobile editing in general and then narrowed it down to short videos.<br/> With the narrowed down versions we asked for input from our peers on which ideas were the best and we came to the idea of side-by-side and markers for Tik-Tok.<br />

						<img src="images/sketches.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: ; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"><br/>
						</a>
						From there I spent hours listening to my team on the amount of different factors that could be problematic trying to add our features into Tik-Tok and came up with lo-fi prototypes to showcase to our peers for even more feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Lo-Fi/User-Flow</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">Since this was just redesigning Tik-Tok's fimling and editing process I wanted to make sure that all of the buttons that were added and/or changed fit into the UI well. To do this the new implementations shouldn't interrupt any existing features and seem "invisible," but at the same time still be discoverable. </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">While keeping the consistency of Tik-Tok's user flow you're still able to see how I added the new features to be discoverable by importing them into areas of typical view. The Lo-fi prototype on the right is the idea of adding sound markers for the filming process and the protoytype below is for the editing process. My team and I presented these ideas to our peers and found the prototypes to lack pracitcality, mainly in the editing, but the whole idea is innovative that shows promise in being useful. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">From our peers, the professor, and group debates, I found out the strengths and weaknesses of the features I wanted to add and how it could be imported smoothly. We conducted a lot of competitive analyses with Tik-Tok's filming and editing along with other mobile editing apps, discussing what they did right and wrong. Taking into account all of the research and feedback I received, I implemented it all into our Lo-Fi designs. With these Lo-Fi designs, I was able to receive more feedback from our peers, making the path to the final product very clear.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">After countless hours of debates and trying to come to final decisions as a team, I was able to come up with our final prototype, taking into account our peers' insight and how it could be designed to be useful for Tik-Tok content creators.</p>

								<h3>Final Product</h3>
								<p>With Side-by-side I wanted to implement new and innovative ways that makes filming and editing for Tik-Tok content creators as efficient as possible. The features that are introduced doesn't get rid of anything, but instead adds more shortcuts and beneficial qualities. We'll go through all of the features in action with explanations.</p>

						<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
						<p style="text-align: left;">Side-by-Side takes Tik-Tok's editing and fimling process to a whole new level. Being given the option to have sound markers, perform retakes that adds into a library, and compare two clips Side-by-Side gives Tik-Tok content creators the ability to enhance their workflow.<br/><br/>
						While there's a lot of promise shown in this redesign there's still room for improvement. While discoverability was heavily considered in the design process I still believe there can be better solutions. Also all of the new features are brand new concepts to most users, and learning them can be overwhelming.
						So there can definitely be ways to work on the simplicity of the features that makes it easier to use and learn.</p>
